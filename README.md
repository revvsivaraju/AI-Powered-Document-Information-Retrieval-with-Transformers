This project focuses on transforming information retrieval by building an AI-powered question-answering system for large documents. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the "deepset/minilm-uncased-squad2" model, the system allows users to ask questions and receive precise answers from extensive texts, enhancing document comprehension and information extraction.
