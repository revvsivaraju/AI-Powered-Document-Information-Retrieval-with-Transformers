Have you never asked yourself how Harry Potter came into being in the mind of J.K. Rowling?
The idea for the JK Harry Potter book series came to Rowling in 1990 on a train from Manchester to London. On the train, she suddenly comes up with the idea for a story about a boy who is drawn into a magical world and must fight an evil wizard.


J.K. Rowling drew from various sources and inspirations for Harry Potter’s main characters and monsters. Harry Potter himself was inspired by a boy Rowling saw on a train platform. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were inspired by Rowling’s college friends. The character of Albus Dumbledore was inspired by Rowling’s own principal during his school days.

Regarding the series’ monsters and magical creatures, Rowling drew on a variety of myths, legends, and folklore from different cultures. For example, the idea of ​​​​the basilisk, a giant snake that can be killed with a glance, comes from a medieval European legend. The character of Hagrid, the half-giant gamekeeper at Hogwarts, was inspired by a biker Rowling met in the West of England. Additionally, several creatures in the series, such as the Hippogriff and the Dementor, were entirely Rowling’s own creations.


How did she come up with the concept of Hogwarts School?
J.K. Rowling came up with the idea for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Harry Potter book series based on her own childhood experiences and love of literature. As a child, Rowling was an avid reader and spent a lot of time in the library, where she discovered classic children’s books and myths and legends from various cultures.

Inspired by her love of literature and her own experiences, Rowling created the concept of a school for young witches and wizards, where they could learn about magic and hone their skills. The idea of a magical school also allowed Rowling to create a rich and detailed world, with its own history, traditions, and customs.


Rowling has said that the architecture of some of the buildings she saw in her travels, particularly in Edinburgh, Scotland, also inspired the look and feel of Hogwarts. Additionally, the school’s four houses — Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin — were inspired by the traditional houses at boarding schools in the United Kingdom, which Rowling attended as a child.
